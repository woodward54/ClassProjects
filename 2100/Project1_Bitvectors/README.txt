Project 1: Bitwise Operations on Bitvectors

This program takes a universal set of items, and a list of found items. If the program finds an item, it adds them to a bitvector and performs bitwise operations such as AND or OR to produce the required outputs.

Final Grade: 110/100

Compiling
- compiled using standard g++
- "g++ main.cpp"

Running
- "./a.out" to run the program

File Input
- The program will ask for the file name, input the exact name for example "input3.txt"
- Make sure the input file is in the same directory as main.cpp
- The program will then ask if the file contains a universal set. Type "yes" or "no"
- input1.txt and input2.txt both contain universal sets, input3.txt creates the univerasl set dynamically.
